#Prints "Hello User!"

    # Then asks "What is your name?"

    # Then responds "Hello <user's name>"

    # Then asks "What is your name?"

    
    
    # Then asks: "What is your year of birth?"

    # Then asks: "Do you know how to drive?"

    # Then asks: "How old were you when you got your driving license" if the user replies "Yes" to the above question

    # Then outputs: "You got your driving license in <year> and you have been driving for <x> years" 

    # Then outputs: "You are <age> years old now but you still can't drive. 
    #   You were supposed to get your license in <year>,<x> years ago at the age of 30 at the latest" If the user replies "No" and is over the age of 30

    # Then outputs: "You are <age> years old now and you should work on getting your driving license before you turn 30. 
    # You have <x> years to go until the year <year>" If the user replies "No" and is under the age of 30

    # Then asks: "Do you know how to drive?"

    # Then asks: "Do you know how to drive?"
